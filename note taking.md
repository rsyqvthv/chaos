[What is your note taking method/workflow](https://subreply.com/sly/h8l)

linear

- I set myself up a [linear.app](https://linear.app/) workspace and I'm quite happy

pen & paper

- Pen and paper for day-to-day note taking and to do lists.
- I jot everything down on paper. I then transcribe these notes and organize them in a Zettelkasten way.

markdown 

-  simple plain text (markdown!) file, and a set of "personal rules" to create my equivalent of a bullet journal.
- a giant text file under version control.
- My work markdown "wiki" is managed with Typora
- non-linear notetaking using [[obsidian]]

tiddlywiki

- I use drift found [here](https://akhater.github.io/drift/) It's written from tiddlywiki. I love it.

Anki

- With regards to remembering things, I use Anki. It's old school, but by far still one of the best flash card apps.

org mode

- I think that orgzly, which is an android implementation of the emacs org-mode deserves a mention here
- org-roam in Emacs
- switching to org mode

telegram

- Fast note taking using saved messages with Telegram

workflowy

- workflowy.com - simple, reliable

other

- I take a lot of notes with Milton.

Notion

- Mostly using Notion now. Was on Roam but wasn't worth paying for IMO. I like the non-linear aspect of it, but I think you also need to organize better than they enable.

Google doc / form

- Google Docs get the bulk of my notes which get commented on and tidied as a project forms.
