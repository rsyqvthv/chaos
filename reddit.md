## boolean

**AND** means you want both sides to be true.
**OR** means only one side needs to be true.
You can negate/exclude certain modifiers by preceding them with **–** (minus sign).

You can use parentheses **()** to group modifiers together in case the search query is a complex mixture of ANDs and ORs.

## limitations

Search terms may be stemmed. A search for "dogs" may return results with the word "dog" in them.
Search results are limited to 1000 results.
