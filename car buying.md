## 找新车

- 推荐在main dealer里面找, 省去很多麻烦. 比如 [toyota](https://www.toyota.co.uk/used-cars)
- [Cargiant](https://www.cargiant.co.uk/) 会有风险
- [autotrader](https://www.autotrader.co.uk) 全靠人品
- [BuyaCar: the easy way to get a great car deal](https://www.buyacar.co.uk/) 主打送车
- [Cazoo - Buy used cars online with free UK home delivery](https://www.cazoo.co.uk/) 主打免费送车

注意

- 租车公司的车别买

## 找专家帮你查车

如果不是在main dealer找车, 那么为了保险起见, 找个专业的人帮你看车是必要的.
