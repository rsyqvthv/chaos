#### Welcome to xBrowserSync!

xBrowserSync is a free and open-source alternative to browser sync services offered by Google, Mozilla, Opera and others, that respects your privacy and gives you complete anonymity (check out the [website](https://link.xbrowsersync.org/www) for more info).

Take a moment to read through this help guide to familiarise yourself with xBrowserSync, using the paging links below or the arrow keys to move between pages.

Please note: xBrowserSync currently only syncs bookmarks. Syncing of additional browser data will be added in future versions, check out the development [roadmap](https://link.xbrowsersync.org/roadmap) to see what’s planned.



#### Before you begin

xBrowserSync modifies your local browser data so it’s a good idea to back up your bookmarks and other browser data just in case, and if you are using any other browser sync services or tools (such as [Google Chrome Sync](https://link.xbrowsersync.org/chrome-sync)) please disable them to avoid conflicts.



#### Syncing for the first time

Before xBrowserSync can sync your browser data you will need to provide an encryption password. Be sure to make it strong but also memorable, there are no resets or reminders so if you forget it you won’t be able to access your synced data.

Your browser data will be encrypted using your password and saved to the active xBrowserSync service configured in the Settings panel.

Once synced, any changes you make to your local bookmarks will be synced automatically by xBrowserSync.



#### Syncing to another service

By default your data is synced to the [official xBrowserSync service](https://link.xbrowsersync.org/api), however if you would like to sync your data to an alternative xBrowserSync service you can switch the active service before syncing.

Check the list of available [public xBrowserSync services](https://link.xbrowsersync.org/service-list) or [run your own service](https://link.xbrowsersync.org/api-repo), either for private use for ultimate security and privacy, or for public use so that more people can enjoy xBrowserSync.

**Important:** xBrowserSync services are run independently by volunteers. The service administrator takes no responsibility for your data so please remember to backup regularly.



#### Your sync ID

xBrowserSync ensures your privacy as no personal data is ever collected and your browser data is encrypted before being synced. To identify your synced data you are provided with an anonymous sync ID which can be used along with your password to sync your data on other browsers and devices.

Remember that your sync ID will only work with the xBrowserSync service on which it was created, if you switch to a different xBrowserSync service you must create a new sync or use an existing sync ID created when previously synced to that service.

Whenever you are synced you can view your sync ID in the Settings panel, click it to reveal a handy QR code to scan when syncing on mobile devices.



#### Syncing with your existing ID

Click on “Already got a sync ID?” to enter your existing sync ID and password. If your sync ID was created on a service different to the one displayed then switch to that service before attempting to sync.

xBrowserSync will retrieve and decrypt your encrypted data using your locally stored password, then clear your local bookmarks before re-populating them from the decrypted data.

When synced, xBrowserSync checks in the background every fifteen minutes for updates to your synced data and will automatically update your local bookmarks when required. You can also manually sync available updates to your synced data in the Settings panel.



#### Searching your bookmarks

Once synced, simply press Enter to display your recent bookmarks or type some keywords or a URL to search your bookmarks.

Toggle between search results and bookmark folders to browse the entire hierarchy.

To edit or delete a bookmark, hover over the bookmark and click the now visible edit icon next to the bookmark’s title.



#### Adding a bookmark

Bookmark the current page by clicking on the bookmark icon in the Search panel. The bookmark’s properties will be populated for you automatically, otherwise add a description and some tags to ensure better search results.

Alternatively, simply click the browser’s “Bookmark this page” button as normal and xBrowserSync will automatically populate the bookmark’s properties (optional permissions must be granted for this to work, check the Settings panel).



#### Native features supported

Feel free to continue using your browser’s native bookmarking features such as the bookmarks bar and bookmarks manager, any changes you make will be synced automatically in the background.

If you have organised your existing bookmarks into folders don’t worry, xBrowserSync will respect and maintain your existing bookmarks hierarchy.



#### Remember to back up

When you use xBrowserSync your data is your responsibility so be smart and make sure to take backups.

Head over to the Settings panel and back up your unencrypted data to a local file which can be used to restore your data should you need to.

If your local browser data becomes corrupted and you don’t have any backups, you can at any time revert your data back to it’s original state from when xBrowserSync was installed.



#### Use shortcuts!

To search your bookmarks quickly, use the default keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Space) to activate the extension, then simply press Enter to view your recent bookmarks or start typing to search.

To change the shortcut, browse to chrome://extensions/shortcuts and update the available shortcuts under xBrowserSync.



#### Go mobile
